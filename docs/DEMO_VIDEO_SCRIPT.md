## SCENE 1: PROBLEM (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Screen: Dark/blurred view of a busy street]**

**Voiceover (warm, empathetic):**
> "285 million people worldwide are visually impaired. Every time they step outside, simple tasks become challenges — crossing a street, reading a sign, finding the right product in a store. Current navigation tools tell you WHERE to go, but not WHAT'S around you."

**[Screen: Statistics overlay]**
- 285M visually impaired worldwide
- 39M completely blind
- 80% of daily navigation is visual

> "What if AI could be your eyes — in real-time?"

## SCENE 2: SOLUTION (0:30 - 1:00)

**[Screen: LiveSight app opening, HUD interface visible]**

**Voiceover:**
> "Meet LiveSight — a real-time AI navigation assistant powered by Gemini Live API."

**[Show architecture diagram briefly]**

> "LiveSight streams live camera video and your voice to Gemini simultaneously. The AI sees what the camera sees, hears what you say, and speaks back naturally — all in real-time."

**[Highlight Gemini features on screen]**
> "We use FOUR Gemini capabilities:
> - Live API for real-time video and audio streaming
> - Function Calling for autonomous navigation actions
> - Native Audio for natural speech — no robotic TTS
> - Multimodal processing — video plus voice in a single session"

### Demo 3D: Voice Commands + SOS (2:10 - 2:30)
**[Show voice interaction]**

**[Show feature grid]**
> "6 AI modes. 8 languages. Fall detection. Emergency SOS. Gamification to encourage exploration. All running in real-time on your phone."

## FILMING TIPS

1. **Use a real phone** — judges want to see it working on a device
2. **Film outdoors** for navigation/traffic scenes — shows real-world capability
3. **Keep the phone camera visible** — viewers need to see input + AI output together
4. **Let the AI speak** — don't talk over Gemini's responses, let judges hear the natural audio
5. **Show haptic feedback** — briefly show phone vibrating on vehicle detection
6. **Keep it smooth** — no pauses, pre-plan your walking route
7. **Good lighting** — AI works better, video looks better
8. **Quiet moments** — let 2-3 seconds of AI narration play uninterrupted

## MUSIC
- Soft, inspiring background music (low volume)
- Cut music during AI speech demos
- Build to crescendo at the end

## RECORDING
- **Resolution:** 1080p minimum
- **Length:** Max 2:55 (leave buffer)
